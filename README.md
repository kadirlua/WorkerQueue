# WorkerQueue
WorkerQueue is a lightweight, cross-platform asynchronous task queue for modern C++ (C++11 and later). It allows for concurrent task execution with customizable worker threads.

# Features
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android)
- Asynchronous task queue management
- Uses modern C++ threading primitives

# Prerequisites
- C++11 or later supported compiler
    - msvc
    - gcc
    - clang
- CMake (Optional)

# Cloning the library
You can clone the library using git. Just run the command as shown below:

```
  > git clone https://github.com/kadirlua/WorkerQueue.git
```

# Building the library
You can build the library using vcpkg or your own environment. You can use Visual Studio, VSCode or CLion IDEs for building.

## Compile the library using cmake
```
  > mkdir build
  > cmake -B build -S .
  > cmake --build build
```

Or with make option
```
  > mkdir build
  > cd build
  > cmake ..
  > make
```

If you want to build as static library (default is shared), you can pass the argument as shown below to cmake for configuration:
```
  > cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
```

## Build options
| Option             | Description                                                     |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| BUILD_SHARED_LIBS  | Enables/disables shared library. Default is ON.                 |
| BUILD_EXAMPLES_SRC | Enables/disables to build examples source codes. Default is ON. |
| BUILD_TESTS_SRC    | Enables/disables to build test source codes. Default is ON.     |

An example:
```
  > cmake -B build -S . -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES_SRC=ON -DBUILD_TESTS_SRC=OFF
```

# Use the library
You can use the library into your project. It's easy to integrate into your project using cmake configuration. Insert the necessary codes into your project as shown below:

CMakeLists.txt:
``` cmake

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.22.1)

project(TestProject VERSION 1.0 LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(WorkerQueue REQUIRED)    # It's required to find the library

add_executable(TestProject main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(TestProject PRIVATE WorkerQueue::WorkerQueue)    # link the library if It's found
```

main.cpp:

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <WorkerQueue.h>

int main()
{
    sdk::concurrency::WorkerQueue w1;
    w1.push([](){
        std::cout << "Test worker message!\n";
    });
    // wait until worker queue has finished
    while (!w1.empty()) {
      std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    }
    return 0;
}
```
