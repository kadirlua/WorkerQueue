# WorkerQueue
Asynchronous Worker Queue based on modern C++. This library allows you to give independent function signatures to the worker queue. It's a cross-platform library that should compile on any operating system without any problem (I have tested on Windows and Linux).

If you have any opinions or questions, please do not hesitate to ask me :)
