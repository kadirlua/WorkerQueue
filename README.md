# WorkerQueue
Asynchronous Worker Queue based on modern C++. This library allows you to give independented function signatures into the worker queue. It's a cross platform library which should compile on any operating system without any problem (I have tested on Windows and Linux).

If you have any opinion or question, please do not hesitate to ask me :)
